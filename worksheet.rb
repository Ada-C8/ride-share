# Step 1: Establish the layers

  # 1. The overall structure is an array called "rides"
  # 2. The value of each index in this array is a hash. This hash pairs "headers" with the data for a particular ride. For example, :driver_id is a key, and the driver's id for that ride is a value. 

########################################################
# Step 2: Assign a data structure to each layer

  # See above: this is an array of hashes - [{}, {}, {}]

# Step 3: Make the data structure!

    # See ride-share.rb

# Step 4: Total Drivers Earnings and Number of Rides

  # The output when you run ride-share.rb:
